        # --- Mocking Setup ---
        # We don't need to create real classes, we can mock the return value
        # of the query that calculates hours. Here, we'll just mock the total hours
        # and hourly rate to achieve a predictable gross salary.

        # Let's assume a gross salary of 250,000,000 Rials to test multiple tax brackets.
        # We can achieve this by mocking the calculation part inside the function,
        # or by passing a pre-calculated gross salary.
        # For simplicity, we'll patch the function to work with a fixed gross salary.

        # Let's define a mock that simulates a teacher's classes.
        # This is complex, so for a focused test on financial logic,
        # it's better to patch the result of the hour calculation.
        # However, the current function calculates it inside.
        # We will adjust the test to provide a fixed gross salary instead.

        # Let's redefine the test to be simpler and focus on the financial logic,
        # assuming we have a gross_salary.

        # but with controlled inputs.

        # Let's assume the teacher taught 100 hours at 2,500,000 per hour.
        # This is not realistic, but gives us the gross salary we want.

        # A better approach: let's test the financial logic separately
        # by calling the functions with direct values.

        # to verify the components.
